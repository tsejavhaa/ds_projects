# 📰 Fake News Detection

## 🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles based on text content.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Text preprocessing (lowercase, remove URLs/punctuation)  
3. TF-IDF vectorization  
4. Logistic Regression classification  
5. Model evaluation with accuracy, ROC-AUC  
6. Example predictions + insights  

## 📈 Results
| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Accuracy | ~0.98 |
| ROC-AUC | ~0.99 |

## 💡 Insights
- Reliable for initial misinformation filtering.  
- Use with human verification for production.  
- Can extend using BERT or DistilBERT for context-aware detection.

## 🧩 Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib
